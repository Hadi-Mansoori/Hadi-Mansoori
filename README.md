## Design Patterns 📚

**Design Patterns** are proven solutions to common problems in software design. Below are some key design patterns that I’m focusing on:

1. **Singleton Pattern**:
   - Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is commonly used in situations where a global state needs to be shared.

2. **Factory Method Pattern**:
   - Provides an interface for creating objects, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It helps in creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

3. **Observer Pattern**:
   - Defines a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This is often used in event handling systems.

4. **Strategy Pattern**:
   - Defines a family of algorithms and allows a client to choose which algorithm to use at runtime. It's useful when multiple algorithms are available to solve a specific problem, and you want to change the algorithm dynamically.

5. **Decorator Pattern**:
   - Allows you to dynamically add behavior or responsibilities to an object without affecting its functionality. It's particularly useful when you want to extend the functionality of classes in a flexible way.

6. **Adapter Pattern**:
   - Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating an adapter that converts one interface into another. It's helpful when integrating systems that have different interfaces.

7. **Facade Pattern**:
   - Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to interact with the system by hiding its complexity.

8. **Command Pattern**:
   - Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and logs. It's often used in undo/redo operations, task scheduling, and logging.
